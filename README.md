## Features

- üöÄ Built with latest Angular and Nx
- üì¶ Monorepo architecture
- üé® Material Design integration
- üñ•Ô∏è Electron support for desktop deployment
- üß™ Comprehensive testing setup
- üîÑ Nx Cloud integration for enhanced build performance
- üìö Sample library components for reference

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v23.3.0 or later)
- npm (v10 or later) or yarn (v1.22 or later)
- Git
